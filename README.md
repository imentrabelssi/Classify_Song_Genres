# Classify_Song_Genres
This project aims to classify songs based on genre using ML techniques

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). I first made use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors we should be aware of when doing machine learning. 
Then, I used the scikit-learn package to predict whether a song's genre was correctly classified based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. I went over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression and decision trees.
